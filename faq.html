              <p>Our motivation is simple: we have valuable digital assets (premium domains), and we believe deploying them to mission-driven organizations creates more value than sitting on them or selling to the highest bidder.</p>
              <p>When pillar communities thrive, we all thrive. This is strategic philanthropy, not charity with strings attached.</p>

              <p>You're responsible for selecting and paying for your own hosting and email services. We provide guidance and recommendations, but don't provide hosting ourselves.</p>
              <p>This ensures you maintain full control and aren't dependent on us for ongoing services. Many affordable options exist—we'll help you find what fits your needs and budget.</p>
